#Query Visualizer

Query Visualizer uses MySQL built in log to record all queries, we then take all those and turn them into json which the browser reads and renders through HTML5 Canvas

##Usage
1. Change ConnectionString in app.config
2. Compile and run
3. Press enter to start/stop logging
4. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
